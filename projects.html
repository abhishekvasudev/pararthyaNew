            <p><u>Save Okhla Bird Sanctuary</u> - Pararthya is working closely with the conservation of Okhla Bird Sanctuary, a wetland heaven for over 300 bird species.
            </p>
            <p>
            It is now one of the 466 IBAs (Important Bird Areas) in India. Lately, there has been an observant decrease in population of migratory birds due to increase in air, noise and water pollution in the Yamuna River, further shrinking the habitat of marshlands and water areas. 
            </p>
            <p>
            With an aim of reviving the sanctuary, Pararthya is carrying out some interventions with Uttar Pradesh Forest Department.

            <p><u>Awareness Program</u> - “Awareness is like the Sun. When it shines on things, they are transformed”. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Public awareness is important to increase enthusiasm and support, stimulate self mobilization and action, and mobilize local knowledge and resources.
